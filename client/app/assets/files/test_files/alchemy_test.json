Helping arts leaders grow their entrepreneurial skills and expertise, so their organizations can thrive both creatively and financially, is a goal we’re proud to support.” Following these roundtables, a prototype program will be presented to established and emerging creative industry professionals during the Banff Summer Arts Festival. ...",
