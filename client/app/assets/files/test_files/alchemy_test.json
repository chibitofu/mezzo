But New Zealander in London Matt Fejos said the pub crawl event was \"really positive\".\nREAD MORE:\n * John Key appalled by #Dildogate: 'It's gone worldwide' \n* Kiwis warned off drunken haka on Waitangi Day pub crawl \n \"The pub crawl has a really good record – I think there's only been one arrest in the past few years.\" ...",

It appears that, despite rumours circulating that the club would close, it is in fact up for sale, according to reports on various publications of repute (via Resident Advisor).
